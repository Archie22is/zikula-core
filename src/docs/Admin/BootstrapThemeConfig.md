Bootstrap Theme Config
======================

In order for the login block to work properly in the bootstrap theme, you must make two modifications to the block
config:

  1. Change the position assignment for the **login block** to **topnav**
  2. **Deactivate** (or delete) other blocks in the **topnav** position (including the "top navigation" block).
