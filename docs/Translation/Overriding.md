# Overriding translations

From [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/override.html#translations):

> Translations are not related to bundles, but to translation domains. For this reason, you can override any bundle translation file from the main `translations/` directory, as long as the new file uses the same domain.

> For example, to override the translations defined in the `Resources/translations/FOSUserBundle.es.yml` file of the FOSUserBundle, create a `/translations/FOSUserBundle.es.yml` file.
