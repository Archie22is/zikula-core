Zikula Code Sprint
==================

Communicate!
------------

Be sure to join the Slack channel (#zcs) and communicate about what you are working on. We don't want people to double
up and work on the same problems. Good communication will help make the Sprint more efficient and effective.


How can I help?
---------------

 - Install Zikula Core-1.4.3. Download the latest build here: http://ci.zikula.org/job/Zikula_Core-1.4.3/
 - Follow the instuctions to install. Evaluate the instructions. Accurate?
 - Following successful installation, click on **every** link you can find. Are the results what you expect?
 - Find and submit **every** form you can find in the core. Are the results what you expect?
 - Perform an upgrade from an existing DB. Did it work? Issues? Again - instructions clear?
 - Install modules and themes. Document what works and what does not. It is important to realize here that not all
   modules and themes will be 100% compatible, although we have worked hard to try to make that so. In some cases
   the bugs you find may be problems with the third-party extension and in other cases, it may be a core problem.

As you proceed through the core, take notes. Be sure to search the existing issues (https://github.com/zikula/core/issues)
to see if any problems you have found have already been submitted. If not, please submit a new ticket.

Review the Documentation
------------------------

The core actually has quite a lot of documentation (see `src/docs`). Read it. Does it make sense to you? Can it be improved?
You can submit PRs for doc fixes as well as code fixes. Find something lacking? Willing to add to the docs? Great! Again,
submit a PR with the new Docs. Don't be too concerned about getting it perfect. It can always be corrected later if needed.

Submitting a ticket
-------------------

PLEASE follow the template in the ticket form. Fill out ALL the information. Find a way to **reproduce** the problem 
behavior. If you cannot reproduce it, then it will be nearly impossible to fix. Give the steps to reproduce the problem.
Give as much information as you can.

Confirm a ticket
----------------

Look through the existing tickets to see if there are any that haven't been confirmed yet. Attempt to confirm the problem
by following the steps outlined by the initial submission. If you can reproduce the problem, leave a comment in the ticket
with your confirmation. If your details vary from the information in the ticket be sure to include that additional information.

Fix a ticket/Submit a PR
------------------------

If you can code, find a ticket you think you can fix. Make a remark in the ticket that you have 'adopted' the ticket and
then begin working to fix it. If you find a fix, please submit a PR to the core. If you need help with this, please
contact any core developer for additional help. We would love to teach you how to do this!
